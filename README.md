# PnutSays

A command-line tool inspired by cowsay, dedicated to pnut.io

## Usage

### Classic

Type `pnutsays` then add the message between double quotes. 

    pnutsays "Welcome to a world of moo, this is so awesome"

### Pnut Printer

Add the `-p` option to generate the appropriate tag.

    pnutsays -p "Hello world, I love you pnutprinter"
    
![printer](http://aya.io/misc/pnutsays-pnutprinter.png)

### Tips

#### Special characters

When typing in most terminals, special characters must be escaped: they have to be preceded by an antislash "\\".

    pnutsays "Welcome to a world of \"moo\", this is so awesome\!"

This is not always true, though. For example you don't have to escape exclamation marks in Linux Mint's terminal, but you do in macOS's one. YMMV

#### Long words

Words longer than the authorized limit will be wrapped to the next line.

    pnutsays "Hello, I am someveeeeerylongwordohlala"

#### ASCII tag

Some pnut clients, like [Apero](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apero/id1219902108?l=fr&ls=1&mt=12), can display fixed-width fonts if you add the tag "#ascii" in the post. This may help display the cow properly. However, Apero automatically switches to fixed-width font for posts that include the pnutprinter tag. YMMV

#### Copy to clipboard

On a Mac, add " | pbcopy" at the end of the command to send the result to the clipboard.

    pnutsays "Welcome to a world of moo, this is so awesome" | pbcopy
        
Some applications add a space character at the end of the text when pasted, please remember to remove it before posting for pnutprinter. The last character in the post has to be the asterisk, right after the pnutprinter tag, as generated by PnutSays.

#### Send to Apero

If [Apero](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apero/id1219902108?l=fr&ls=1&mt=12) is running, send directly the pnutsays content to a new post with this command:

    open "apero://post=$(pnutsays \"Hello from Apero and pnutsays\")"
